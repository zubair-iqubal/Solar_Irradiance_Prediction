# Solar_Irradiance_Prediction
## Overview

This project aims to predict solar irradiance using machine learning models like MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and XGBoost. The goal is to enhance energy planning, improve solar panel efficiency, and support sustainable energy initiatives by forecasting solar power availability.

## Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind Speed

Solar Zenith Angle

Cloud Cover

Time-based data (e.g., hour, day, month)

These features were chosen for their correlation with solar irradiance levels.

## Features

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonality, and correlations in the dataset.

Model Development: Implemented MLP and XGBoost models with optimized hyperparameters.

Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
